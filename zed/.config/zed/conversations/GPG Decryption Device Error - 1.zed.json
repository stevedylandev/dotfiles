The specific error \"Inappropriate ioctl for device\" often appears when GPG can't properly access a terminal or pinentry program to prompt for a passphrase.\n\nHere are some common causes and solutions:\n\n1. GPG agent might not be running or properly configured\n2. The GPG command might be running in a context without proper terminal access\n3. There might be issues with the pinentry program that GPG uses for password prompts\n\nTo fix this, you can try:\n\n1. Ensure GPG agent is running:\n```bash\ngpg-agent --daemon\n```\n\n2. Set the GPG_TTY environment variable:\n```bash\nexport GPG_TTY=$(tty)\n```\n\n3. Make sure you have a pinentry program installed and properly configured\n\n4. If you're running this in a script or automated context, you might need to adjust how you're providing the passphrase or configure GPG to use a different pinentry method.\n\nThe LANG and LANGUAGE environment variables in your command are just setting the locale to US English, and shouldn't be related to the core issue.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":126}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":260,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":127}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":1412,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":128}}}],"summary":"GPG Decryption Device Error","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
