## Steve's Dotfiles

Here's a collection of dotfiles that I use regularly on my MacOS development environment. If you want to use them simply copy them to their appropriate locations, majority of them being in `~/.config`.

**A few things to be aware of:**

- Alacritty is expecting a Nerd font patched verson of [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/) which I have included in `assets` since it is open source!
- The color scheme is `base16-black-metal-bathory`, which should be available in any theme plugin that offers base16
