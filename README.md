## Steve's Dotfiles

Here's a collection of dotfiles that I use regularly on my MacOS development environment. If you want to use them simply copy them to their appropriate locations, majority of them being in `~/.config`.

**A few things to be aware of:**

- Alacritty is expecting a Nerd font patched verson of [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/) which I have included in `assets` since it is open source!
- The color scheme is built using [Tinted Themeing Base16](https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-shell) which allows you to use the shell to change the color scheme for all the apps used; just try something like `base16-rose-pine`. I would recommend installing via the instructions on their repo vs trying to install by cloning this one. In the screenshot I am using `base16-black-metal-bathory`.
