## Steve's Dotfiles

Here's a collection of dotfiles that I use regularly on my MacOS development environment. If you want to use them simply copy them to their appropriate locations, majority of them being in `~/.config`.

**A few things to be aware of:**
- Alcritty is expecting a custom font called [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/) which I have included here since it is open source!
- The color scheme for everything is based off [Tinted Themeing Base16](https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-shell) which allows you to use the shell to change the color scheme for all the apps used. In the screenshot I am using `base16-black-metal-bathory`.
